# Gloss-free-MLSLT (ACL2025)

Official Implementation of paper "Multilingual Gloss-free Sign Language Translation:
Towards Building a Sign Language Foundation Model"

## Paper Highlights
We propose a multilingual gloss-free model with dual CTC objectives for token-level SL identification and spoken text generation. Our model supports 10 SLs and handles one-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to-many SLT tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on three widely adopted benchmarks: multilingual SP-10, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily.
